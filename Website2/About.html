                    <h1>ABOUT</h1> 
                    <p>Hiya! I'm Max, and I hope you've enjoyed my silly website so far!</p>
                    <p>I'm a 21-year-old Portuguese queer in an eternal battle between the crimpling anxiety of my inevitable decay and the limits of my brain that only let me do a few things before having to deal with burnout.</p>
                    <p>After choosing STEM over a career in music, I moved to a new city for college and lost most connections to what had been my main source of artistic fulfillment. I still went to jam sessions, but I didn't have my drum kit, and all my band members had gone to different places so we effectively separated. I was basically very sad. I filled the gaps with creative writing and TTRPGs but 3 years ago I decided to buy a Huion H640P and learn how to draw. I was told as a kid that I didn't have any talent for it, but I'm pretty sure you can get good at anything with enough hard work, and that's what I'm doing.</p>
                    <p>It's going well so far!</p>
                    <p>I made POLARIS to learn the basics of comic making, and I made a website cuz having a website is hella fun and I didn't feel like posting it in a proper place until I had enough episodes. It started off as a simple place, but I wanted it to be silly and fun so after over 120 hours working on it, here we are! Honestly, I'm really proud of it.</p>
                    <em class="poem">Max is dreaming and she must wake up. For a clock keeps ticking, the race has begun, and a Jack of all trades, master of none, is oftentimes merrier than the master of one.</em>
